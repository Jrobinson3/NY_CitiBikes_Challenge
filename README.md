# NY_CitiBikes_Challenge
In Tableau, create a new Story using visualizations that will support the key findings you want to show.
1. You must use the five visualizations that you created in Deliverable 2.
2. You must use at least two visualizations that you created in this module.
3. In your README markdown file, include the following:
Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. This analysis will help you to answer any questions that investors may have.
Results: Using the visualizations you have in your Tableau Story, describe the results of each visualization underneath the image.
1. Create the Checkout Times for Users Viz
 Looking at the snapshot of the day, from midnight to 2 AM, many bikes were used. From 1 am to 2 am, people not only used more bikes, but also used longer minutes. 
2. Create the Checkout Times by Gender Viz
 This is using the same set of the database, but additionally has genders as one of the factors.  The top users of the bikes are male; compared to the other gender, males tend to utilize longer minutes. 
3. Create the Trips by Weekday for Each Hour Viz
This visualization revealed that more people used bikes during rush hours (8 am to 9 am & 5 pm to 7 pm).  However, this was not true during the weekend as more people used bikes during 11 am to 1 pm. 
4. Create the Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour) Viz
During rush hours from Monday to Friday, the bikes were used much more by males.  During the weekend, the unknown gender used the bikes more than other genders. 
5. Create the User Trips by Gender by Weekday Viz
Subscribers used the bikes much more than the non-subscribers: out of these subscriberers, the male gender used more bikes compared to the other genders.  

Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.
By using the data collected, I concluded that many people used bikes to travel to work. Compared to the other genders though, males tended to actively use the bikes as a form of transportation. 
When focusing on details like the time, unknown genders tended to utilize the bikes more during weekends. It's apparent that subscribers used the bikes more than non-subscribers.
Additionally, providing visualization for the Peak Hours in Aug. and Top ending location helps to locate more bikes at the peak hours in August within the preferable location.
